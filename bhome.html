  <p><h1>Basic concepts</h1>
  <ul>
  <li><h2>Arduino : </h2><p>Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on Processing.

Over the years Arduino has been the brain of thousands of projects, from everyday objects to complex scientific instruments. A worldwide community of makers - students, hobbyists, artists, programmers, and professionals - has gathered around this open-source platform, their contributions have added up to an incredible amount of accessible knowledge that can be of great help to novices and experts alike.

Arduino was born at the Ivrea Interaction Design Institute as an easy tool for fast prototyping, aimed at students without a background in electronics and programming. As soon as it reached a wider community, the Arduino board started changing to adapt to new needs and challenges, differentiating its offer from simple 8-bit boards to products for IoT applications, wearable, 3D printing, and embedded environments. All Arduino boards are completely open-source, empowering users to build them independently and eventually adapt them to their particular needs. The software, too, is open-source, and it is growing through the contributions of users worldwide.

Why Arduino?
Thanks to its simple and accessible user experience, Arduino has been used in thousands of different projects and applications. The Arduino software is easy-to-use for beginners, yet flexible enough for advanced users. It runs on Mac, Windows, and Linux. Teachers and students use it to build low cost scientific instruments, to prove chemistry and physics principles, or to get started with programming and robotics. Designers and architects build interactive prototypes, musicians and artists use it for installations and to experiment with new musical instruments. Makers, of course, use it to build many of the projects exhibited at the Maker Faire, for example. Arduino is a key tool to learn new things. Anyone - children, hobbyists, artists, programmers - can start tinkering just following the step by step instructions of a kit, or sharing ideas online with other members of the Arduino community.

There are many other microcontrollers and microcontroller platforms available for physical computing. Parallax Basic Stamp, Netmedia's BX-24, Phidgets, MIT's Handyboard, and many others offer similar functionality. All of these tools take the messy details of microcontroller programming and wrap it up in an easy-to-use package. Arduino also simplifies the process of working with microcontrollers, but it offers some advantage for teachers, students, and interested amateurs over other systems:

Inexpensive - Arduino boards are relatively inexpensive compared to other microcontroller platforms. The least expensive version of the Arduino module can be assembled by hand, and even the pre-assembled Arduino modules cost less than $50
Cross-platform - The Arduino Software (IDE) runs on Windows, Macintosh OSX, and Linux operating systems. Most microcontroller systems are limited to Windows.
Simple, clear programming environment - The Arduino Software (IDE) is easy-to-use for beginners, yet flexible enough for advanced users to take advantage of as well. For teachers, it's conveniently based on the Processing programming environment, so students learning to program in that environment will be familiar with how the Arduino IDE works.
Open source and extensible software - The Arduino software is published as open source tools, available for extension by experienced programmers. The language can be expanded through C++ libraries, and people wanting to understand the technical details can make the leap from Arduino to the AVR C programming language on which it's based. Similarly, you can add AVR-C code directly into your Arduino programs if you want to.
Open source and extensible hardware - The plans of the Arduino boards are published under a Creative Commons license, so experienced circuit designers can make their own version of the module, extending it and improving it. Even relatively inexperienced users can build the breadboard version of the module in order to understand how it works and save money.</p></li>
  <li><h2>Top Technologies : </h2>
  <h3>#5.  5-G Network  </h3><p>It is among the most popular technologies trending technologies in IT industry. Why is 5G considered to be the latest technologies in software industry? Well, is the newest technology today.

This one is one of the most anticipated and latest technological developments of this decade. It is one of the most practically useful among the latest software technologies list. It is present in selected cities and areas for now but it will be available to the general public in 2020. 20 Gbps high-speed wireless connectivity will be available in your pockets.

Without a doubt, 5G is sure to revolutionize the day-to-day devices, with smartphones at the top. It is not just high speed, 5G means lower latency and greater bandwidth availability are huge advantages of 5G network proliferation.

These latest software trends will reduce or remove certain limitations present in 4G. Not only will the developers be able to create more powerful apps, the video, and AR use will also become better. There will be a significant improvement in security, and in the precision of data for movement-based apps.

Advancement in IoT will be ceased if 5G won’t develop. Driverless cars, smart devices will depend on the high speed, processing power, and lower latency of 5G for optimal performance. IoT is also instrumental for the growth of VR-AR games, self-driving cars, drone delivery, and many other things

A hundred times faster network than 4G, 5G promises to offer speeds more than 1Gb/s (1000Mbit/s) compared to download speeds of 300Mbit/ of top-end 4G networks, known variously as 4G+, LTE-A or 4.5G.</p>
 <p><h3>#4.  Progressive Web Applications  </h3>
  In the past few years, android app developers have realized the cons of websites and mobile apps. This gave birth to PWAs that happen to have found the perfect middle ground.

They are extremely easy to develop and maintain and hence attracted many mobile app development companies. Moreover, these apps can be loaded very fast even with low internet speed.

Websites offer the convenience of being accessible from any browser while apps can fully embrace the hardware and software capabilities of their native platform. PWAs have combined the best of both worlds.

These apps integrate new web technologies into a solution that makes it easy to create powerful multi-platform web-based tools. They are different from regular apps and the integral part of every PWA is a browser script that runs in the background, separate from the web page, called the Service Worker.
Google and Microsoft have heavily invested in this technology. In fact, Aliexpress increased conversion rate by 104% and a 74% increase in time spent per session.

Instead of spending time and money on building mobiles, progressive web app seems to be a much better option. They are developed quicker and provide similar or more benefits.

PWAs show improvements in sessions per user, reading completion, and overall engagement. Paving way for more companies to jump on board, with next year as the perfect context to do so.</p>
<p><h3>#3.  IoT  </h3>
PWC estimated that over 90% of automobiles by 2020 will be IoT enabled. In fact, according to a former researcher of CISCO- David Evan’s calculations, every second over 127 new devices will be connected to the internet.

Statista reported that there were around 23.14 billion devices in 2018 and the number will reach 26.66 billion by 2019.

The Internet of Things is covering a broad range of devices that are connected to the internet. Whether these devices are in customer or industrial domains, IoT applications have spread to all of them.

This trend is emerging all around us- from smart air conditioners to Bluetooth trackers and home-assistants, internet-connected devices are no longer restricted to computers and smartphones.</p>
<p><h3>#2.  Blockchain  </h3>
Talking about new trends in technology can not be possible without mentioning this new tech in computer science.

Blockchain became the talk of the town with the introduction of digital currencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Blockchain is intensively used in the finance sector, it is now also being applied in banking, finance, media and publishing, and healthcare software development.

Blockchain technology helps in secured and simplified recording of transactions in a decentralized ledger. This makes it strategically important for businesses in all industrial verticals.

This decentralized nature is its biggest strength- it can store any type of record in a public-facing database that is extremely secure from hackers. They can’t easily attack and corrupt this data. This has poised it to have a great effect on the future of latest software development trends.

A large number of companies are planning to try their hands on blockchain development services and therefore blockchain software developers are much in demand.
This technology is developing in a really fast space and is one of the latest developments in technology. Blockchain software developers are finding new and interesting ways to implement it.

Distributed apps or dApps are recent technological developments that are blockchain-based apps. These have emerged as a popular option for software developers to create decentralized secure open-source solutions.

It is predicted that blockchain which was initially heavily focussed on financial services will now change its direction of development. It will be utilized more in supply chain tracking.</p>
<p><h3>#1.  Artificial Intelligence  </h3>
Our list of new technologies begins with a very obvious name in the latest technology trends of software industry. Artificial intelligence seems overhyped to most but not to us. In fact, humans finally have the power and potential to make AI tools a reality.

This technology is evolving at a fast pace, almost exploding for the last five years. Machines can now think intelligently like humans and perform tasks that were initially restricted to humans.

AI has various subsets including machine learning, deep learning, and the neural network that have individually grown exponentially over just 5 years. In fact, according to GlobeNewswire, 61% of business professionals determined AI along with ML as their paramount data initiatives for the year 2019.

Most business software now integrate these techs to provide better to their customers. These tools have broad applications that have transformed industries. Yet, we are still in the early stages of Artificial Intelligence services in the enterprise.

One of the newest trends technologies in development of apps and websites is the chatbot. AI chatbots have replaced human assistance and customer service. They have reduced human involvement in almost everything and thus made it less prone to errors.

2020 will bring more chatbots, accurate customer behavior analysis and lesser human resource engagement. AI will make every task automatic with reliability and speed.</p>
