<h2>Importance of final year project</h2>
<p>Let’s start by discussing why final year projects are so important. We have heard people talking about how the engineering system in India is theoretical, with less opportunity for more hands-on experience. Well, the one place where students do get the freedom to explore and innovate is in their final year engineering project. So, it is safe to say that the final year project is a monumental piece of work that goes a long way in helping potential employers gauge the skill of a student.

When you apply for a job at an MNC or a corporate company, many ask about what you worked on for your final year project. They do so because hearing you talk about your project will give them a good idea about where your interests lie and what amount of skill you have in that field. It is also a good way for them to gauge how innovative and creative you are. The more unique your project, the more impressed they will be by your choice of topic. Generally, the three things that are scrutinized the most during a job interview are your internships, your CGPA, and your final year project. So, make sure you make it count.</p>
